    "## **What is Multimodal Parsing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal parsing refers to the ability of a model to process and understand multiple forms of data simultaneously. In the context of LlamaParse, this means the model can handle not just text but also images, tables, and other document elements. This approach is particularly useful for documents like PDFs where the information is presented in various formats (text, images, charts, etc.)."

    "- A screenshot of every page of your document is taken\n",
    "- Each page screenshot is sent to the multimodal with instruction to extract as markdown\n",
    "- The resulting markdown of each page is consolidated into the final result.\n",
